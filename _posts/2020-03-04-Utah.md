## Introduction
I’ve seen a significant increase in the number of news articles on bullying in Utah recently. Last December, a substitute fifth grade teacher (rightfully) lost her job because she insulted a student who gave thanks to his two dads.[Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/us/Utah-substitute-teacher.html)   July of last year, a biracial boy was dragged by bus when the driver closed the door on his backpack. His mother won a suit against the school district, but not until after the bus driver cited the color of his dog as proof that he is not racist. [Link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/19/school-bus-dragging-case-utah-family-wins-settlement-district/1776915001/)  Early this year, a lawmaker in Southern Utah filed a resolution with the sole intent of discouraging schools with racist mascots from changing them.

I have to say, this has not been my experience living here. I live in perhaps the most diverse area of the state, and my autistic son attends a school where diversity is celebrated. As a white boy who only speaks English, he is a minority here. It can be easy to become inoculated from the rest of the world, or even just the rest of the state, and assume that your experiences are reflective of the greater human experience. With that in mind, I decided to investigate my state.
I set out with three main questions:
1. How has the population of Utah changed, demographically?
2. Have Utah schools matched these demographic changes?
3. Have the incidents of bullying changed along with the demographic changes of the state?

## Population Changes
I began my investigation by looking on census.gov for population statistics. It seemed like the last population would be a good place to start. I was able to find most of what I needed there [Link](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/utah_demograhics.csv) , although I did supplement with a table distributed by the University of Utah in 2017 containing some estimates [Link](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/RaceandEthnicity_FactSheet20170825.pdf) .  
I cleaned the data using Google Colab [Link](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/Utah_Homogenous.ipynb) , and cut away quite a bit of data that was interesting, but not very relevant to my questions. I was left with the following data:

| |	Census 2010 |	2011 |	2013 |	2015 |	2017 |	2019 |
| :------ |:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |
|	Total |	2763885 |	2816124 |	2902663 |	2990632 |	3103000 |	3188160 |
|	White |	2226363 |	2260029 |	2315395 |	2368257 |	2386098 |	2486764.8 |
|	Hispanic |	358340 |	358340 |	387701 |	407498 |	434288 |	452718.72 |
|	Black |	26328 |	26328 |	29326 |	31088 |	43230 |	44634.24 |
|	American Indian or Alaskan Native |	27228 |	27228 |	27853 |	28922 |	47582 |	47822.4 |
|	Asian |	54794 |	54794 |	62993 |	69302 |	79393 |	86080.32 |
|	Pacific Islander or Hawaiian Native |	24183 |	24183 |	26208 |	27896 |	32429 |	35069.76 |
|	Two or More |	46649 |	46649 |	53187 |	57651 |	78813 |	82892.16 |

The data showed me something I was already aware of: Utah is virtually homogenous. However, I was surprised by the level of homogeneity.  According to [WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/most-least-diverse-states-in-america/38262/), Utah is the 44th least diverse state in the union. Despite some minority growth over the last ten years, Utah remains about 80% White.  There has, however, been a small increase in minority populations over the last decade. Here's the data in a lovely easily digestible chart:

![Utah Population](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3tWRQLKS9mLjslGWxNl6gsuaRqJNd-CG_nqvvtVuzI08NLMBnwEPopnE9RC1FMgYZUihQlwOjCIOmdAOUEqVdjjEZaUoO84mI7AyiyVVeBuVyw4_JdrDK1q5qSVvRA4bmhES6UlJ-Q=w2400)

Notice the nearly solid line at the bottom of the chart indicating changes in Utah’s minority population. I decided to make another chart focusing on the demographic changes of the minority populations in Utah, to get a clearer picture.

![Utah Population Minority](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8eTihK1q1sqIUWUHdCqE6NmzwH1kcKfD_rPsjc6g7DzLJbU0LLCWchHOVlZmx4vrc5z4xfkty6ldKK6JMXwv2mcsIsdRBsekGpcDpJYP_jLqy_xpIj16efhrJdZfzV64L6JmsBPwgw=w2400)

This chart shows the very slight changes in minority demographics in Utah over the last ten years.
Obviously, the answer to my first question is, not much. 

## School Demographic Changes

It's not unreasonable to expect school demographics to mirror the population demographics in the state, but I had to be sure. I found school demographic data on data.gov and cleaned it using the same Colab notebook previously mentioned.

![School Population](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/PyF9lgG44wy_YpVBddUcFr_KDKCsBge_acwbdcSZEXkjtxbDrz1BB4g1AolHHCfpfsX2_YsLqkQ0NdQaimePKCjo6Rt0xX0_fpxWBcPNIhE0l9n_g-a1ztyn5dm0c-Qj62ULt-XRNg=w2400)

While not quite identical, school demographics do match up with the overall population demographics well. I wanted to check on the minority changes as well, to see if they also match.

![School Population Minority](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ukAehfY77gLQDLIK42TNPDxOWZ5YUAjEsyG-9szzTA8WeoqA0csLsJTisl1KNg5ilYqrrWlhoGA81PpjNoo2TDWlK6VblF-Ho4Tgf5Wkzu4QP4pR8t0ulpUleVEliznI_OPoRr1KOA=w2400)

There is quite a bit more spread in the school population minority demographics than in Utah's population minority demographics. Despite the difference, the two graphs match up nicely in comparison. The diversity of Utah schools tends to match up with the diversity of the state in general, which is to say, there isn't much diversity here.

## Bullying
It's long been my opinion that Utah doesn't do enough for the adolescents who live here. Utah has the lowest per student spending in the nation ([Source](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html)) and a teen suicide rate that is twice the national average ([Source](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/health-of-women-and-children/measure/teen_suicide/state/ALL)). It's common knowledge that bullying is one of the factors that increases a person's risk of suicide. Yet, most schools employ a zero-tolerance policy, which holds victims equally culpable as their bullies. The Utah ACLU has been denouncing zero tolerance policies for years([Source](https://www.acluutah.org/blog/item/904-zero-tolerance-zero-sense-students-need-better)). More recently, teachers in Salt Lake held a walk out to draw attention to the need for increased funding so they can adequately support their students, a move that was not supported by the local government ([Source](https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/02/27/utahs-republican-leaders/)). It's worth noting that the Salt Lake area has the most diversity in Utah. 
Given the (albeit slight) changes in Utah's demographics and, subsequently, school demographics, I wanted to examine incidents of bullying in Utah schools to see if there have been any notable changes. Once again, I found the data at data.gov and cleaned it using the same notebook. I split the incidents by year, and I chose to look only at reported incidents and disciplined incidents.

![Bullying by Race](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/t-_1renDCq4EUnXJJdjurL14VlmfL66tiH-i70SnwBhIs7KSjZoi3oF4FGcMQuFUmxhxdfXQWPlAk1F9Nz5J9ly0Wk2fhOxcejHmYH2CmZ78bzVdnd7-GdxSGzSrzHwnmLAjQplYAQ=w2400)

It's notable that beginning in 2011, the number of reported incidents is less than the number of disciplined incidents. This says, to me, that some number of incidents were witnessed by a teacher or staff member and therefore did not require reporting. Additionally, it suggests that adults in charge are aware of and looking out for their students. 

Incidents have a dramatic increase in 2011, which corresponds to the increase in minority populations in Utah. Despite the relatively level change in population demographics after 2011, bullying incidents decrease. Perhaps this is a sign of progress? 

## Opportunities for Further Study
It will be interesting to update my population information once Census 2020 is finished. I may also want to go back even further to older census data and try to predict if Utah will still be overwhelmingly white when the sun explodes. Even more than that, though, the bullying data I obtained from data.gov included data on the race of those accused of bullying and those disciplined for it. I would like to dive deeper and see if those statistics are reflective of the overall population.
