## Introduction
I’ve seen a significant increase in the number of news articles on bullying in Utah recently. Last December, a substitute fifth grade teacher (rightfully) lost her job because she insulted a student who gave thanks to his two dads.[Link](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/us/Utah-substitute-teacher.html)   July of last year, a biracial boy was dragged by bus when the driver closed the door on his backpack. His mother won a suit against the school district, but not until after the bus driver cited the color of his dog as proof that he is not racist. [Link](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/19/school-bus-dragging-case-utah-family-wins-settlement-district/1776915001/)  Early this year, a lawmaker in Southern Utah filed a resolution with the sole intent of discouraging schools with racist mascots from changing them.

I have to say, this has not been my experience living here. I live in perhaps the most diverse area of the state, and my autistic son attends a school where diversity is celebrated. As a white boy who only speaks English, he is a minority here. It can be easy to become inoculated from the rest of the world, or even just the rest of the state, and assume that your experiences are reflective of the greater human experience. With that in mind, I decided to investigate my state.
I set out with three main questions:
1. How has the population of Utah changed, demographically?
2. Have Utah schools matched these demographic changes?
3. Have the incidents of bullying changed along with the demographic changes of the state?

## Population Changes
I began my investigation by looking on census.gov for population statistics. It seemed like the last population would be a good place to start. I was able to find most of what I needed there [Link](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/utah_demograhics.csv) , although I did supplement with a table distributed by the University of Utah in 2017 containing some estimates [Link](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/RaceandEthnicity_FactSheet20170825.pdf) .  
I cleaned the data using Google Colab [Link](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/Utah_Homogenous.ipynb) , and cut away quite a bit of data that was interesting, but not very relevant to my questions. I was left with the following data:

| |	Census 2010 |	2011 |	2013 |	2015 |	2017 |	2019 |
| :------ |:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |
|	Total |	2763885 |	2816124 |	2902663 |	2990632 |	3103000 |	3188160 |
|	White |	2226363 |	2260029 |	2315395 |	2368257 |	2386098 |	2486764.8 |
|	Hispanic |	358340 |	358340 |	387701 |	407498 |	434288 |	452718.72 |
|	Black |	26328 |	26328 |	29326 |	31088 |	43230 |	44634.24 |
|	American Indian or Alaskan Native |	27228 |	27228 |	27853 |	28922 |	47582 |	47822.4 |
|	Asian |	54794 |	54794 |	62993 |	69302 |	79393 |	86080.32 |
|	Pacific Islander or Hawaiian Native |	24183 |	24183 |	26208 |	27896 |	32429 |	35069.76 |
|	Two or More |	46649 |	46649 |	53187 |	57651 |	78813 |	82892.16 |

The data showed me something I was already aware of: Utah is virtually homogenous. However, I was surprised by the level of homogeneity.  According to [WalletHub](https://wallethub.com/edu/most-least-diverse-states-in-america/38262/), Utah is the 44th least diverse state in the union. Despite some minority growth over the last ten years, Utah remains about 80% White.  There has, however, been a small increase in minority populations over the last decade. Here's the data in a lovely easily digestible chart:

![Utah Population](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/Utah%20Pop.png)

Notice the nearly solid line at the bottom of the chart indicating changes in Utah’s minority population. I decided to make another chart focusing on the demographic changes of the minority populations in Utah, to get a clearer picture.

![Utah Population Minority](https://github.com/JaimieOnigkeit/Lambda-Unit-1-Build-Week/blob/master/Utah%20Pop%20Min.png)

This chart shows the very slight changes in minority demographics in Utah over the last ten years.
Obviously, the answer to my first question is, not much. 

## School Demographic Changes

It's not unreasonable to expect school demographics to mirror the population demographics in the state. I found school demographic data on data.gov and cleaned it using the same Colab notebook previously mentioned. 

## Bullying
It's long been my opinion that Utah doesn't do enough for the adolescents who live here. Utah has the lowest per student spending in the nation ([Source](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/education-data/state-education-spending-per-pupil-data.html)) and a teen suicide rate that is twice the national average ([Source](https://www.americashealthrankings.org/explore/health-of-women-and-children/measure/teen_suicide/state/ALL)). It's common knowledge that bullying is one of the factors that increases a person's risk of suicide. Yet, most schools employ a zero-tolerance policy, which holds vitims equally culpable as their bullies. The Utah ACLU has been denoucing zero tolerance ploicies for years([Source](https://www.acluutah.org/blog/item/904-zero-tolerance-zero-sense-students-need-better)). More recently, teachers in Salt Lake held a walk out to draw attention to the need for increased funding so they can adequately support their students, a move that was not supported by the local government ([Source](https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2020/02/27/utahs-republican-leaders/)). It's worth noting that the Salt Lake area has the most diversity in Utah. 
Given the (albeit slight) changes in Utah's demographics and, subsequently, school demographics, I wanted to examine incidents of bullying in Utah schools to see if there have been any notable changes. Once again, I found the data at data.gov and cleaned it using the same notebook. I split the incidents by year, and by subject of harrassment (disability, sex, or race). I chose to look only at reported incidents versus disciplined incidents.
